    <p class="first">It's been almost 2 years since I first started learning HTML, and CSS, and in all that time I've been thinking, "Wow, this is pretty easy!" The first year and a half of learning, I pretty much dove into it all on my own. I watched tutorials on youtube, read some outdated books I found at thrift stores, and signed up for Codecademy. Then a course came up at the local college for HTML, CSS, and Responsive Web Design. It fit into my budget and schedule, so I signed up. It's a great class. It is still a current class for me now as we are learning Javascript. Learning to code now with like minded people and to have someone I can ask questions and get answers right away from is a greater step forward to reaching my goal to become a web developer. You can only go so far on your own. Taking this class made me realize there is more to web development than coding. Things I never considered. Such as, planning a web site with a team, the who, what, and why you are building a website for, responsiveness. Wow, and I thought I was getting somewhere on my own. There are things about coding when you first start out that aren't even thought of. The one that stood out for me the most was Browser Compatibility. Who knew that the web page you've been designing would break apart and look not so user friendly on a totally different browser than the one you built it on!</p>
    
    <p>For the amount of time and energy one spends on learning to build websites, you would want it to work for everyone right? Especially on all devices and operating systems. The importance of browser compatibility is as important as knowing your web page begins with !DOCTYPE html. </p>
  
    <p>Understanding and working towards making your web page look good and be responsive across many arrays of devices, requires some research. There are plenty of online tools that can help make your work easier. But the best way is to actually physically try your pages on multiple devices, and operating systems. Each system has a different browser which interprets the code in it's own way.</p>
  
    <p>The browsers job is to render the code it's given and display it the way it was written to the user. Creating a website with this knowledge of browser compatibility gives the user your full intent of given info, and no loss of performance. You have to take in that users use old out of date browsers, and up to date ones. This can make things challenging. You have to be aware of what browsers are able to translate. Older browsers often are unable to read some of the new code that has been implemented recently, and it's your job to figure that out. If not, your page will break, and that's not good for you, your client or the user.</p>
  
    <p>Pages you've built also need to apply the correct code for screen sizes, and resolution. Does it get any easier for coders!! Just knowing about this is a great big plus for any new comer to developing. Keeping this in mind can help us build beautiful and user friendly websites for every walk of life, and have our pages keep our reach far and wide!</p>
  
    <p>To sum up, not everyone uses the same browser platform. Screen sizes and resolution have a big part in the correct rendering of websites we build. All browsers render code differently. So do your research!! Check your site on multiple devices and use the online tools that can help validate your work. Have fun and design awesome sites that everyone can enjoy, even if they have the first web browser in existence. Well, maybe.. Cheers!!</p>
